8. Given the program files main.c, circle.h and circle.c:

    a.) What commands will compile the source files into object files?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -c main.c circle.c
        
    b.) What command will link the object files
        into an executable named broken?
        
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -o broken main.o circle.o
        
    c.) Why does the program compile but fail to link?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	The circle.c file did not spell the function "getArea" correctly.
	It used "getAreas" insted of "getArea" and this caused the program to not link successfully.
