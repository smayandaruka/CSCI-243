files and directories?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	ls -F

3. What command would you use to change your working directory from
your home directory to the existing subdirectory Courses/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	cd Courses

4. Within the Courses/ subdirectory, what command would you use to
create the subdirectory csci243/?

    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	mkdir csci243

5. When warning.c is compiled as: 
        gcc -c warning.c
    There is no indication of any warnings/problems.
    
    a.) What compiler flag is used to enable the display of warnings?
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)
    
	-Wall

    b.) In your own words, explain all warnings from compiling warning.c.
    
        <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	The first warning means that variable ‘b’ was assigned a value but it was never used after that.
	The second warning shows that main will accept either 0 or 2 arguments but we are providing only 1 argument.
	The third warning shows that the function ‘compute’ was supposed to return an integer but it does not return anything.
	The last warning shows us that x is used as a variable without initialization. Basically, we just created the variable, did not initialize it and just used it.
    
    c.) Fix warning.c so it compiles without warning and runs correctly.

	(Your answer is the submitted code.)

6. What compiler flag compiles C programs using the ISO C99 standard?

7. Put the four steps of compilation process into their proper order from
first to last.

    A. Link
    B. Assemble
    C. Preprocess
    D. Compile
    
    <<< YOUR ANSWER BELOW HERE (and do not remove this line)

	C, D, B, A
	Preprocess, Compile, Assemble, and Link
