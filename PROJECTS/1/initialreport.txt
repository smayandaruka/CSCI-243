	[INSERT ANSWERS AFTER EACH QUESTION AND ADD MORE LINES AS NEEDED.]
	[MAKE YOUR ANSWERS SHORT AND TO THE POINT. BULLET POINTS ARE GOOD.]

===== In what cases does the program run correctly?  =================
My program initializes the forest correctly. It reads in command line
arguments correctly as well. All my error messages are printed
correctly.

===== In what cases does the program fail and how?  ==================
The program fails to run in an infinite loop (or till no more fires).
I have spent a lot of time figuring out wha's wrong with my logic
but I can't seem to find any flaws even though there definitely is
something wrong.

===== If applicable, what were the extra credit results?  ============
===== If applicable, describe how to run the extra credit.  ==========


===== How much time did I spend on the project?  =====================
I spent almost a full week on this project. I know it's a long time
and I did most of my work on my local machine and I had a hard drive
crash after which I lost everything and I had to start over. No excuses
though.

===== What did I learn?  =============================================
I learned a lot about reading and parsing command line arguments.
Also, I learned how to overwrite stuff on the console using cursor-
controlled functions. I learned how to seed and generate random numbers.

===== What was easy in this assignment?  =============================
Honestly, there wasn't much easy in this assignment except generating
random numbers.

===== What gave me problems or troubles?  ============================
I am still facing issues with cycling through the forest and updating.
It works the first time and then there is a flaw in the logic.

===== What would be the most important improvement for the project?  =
Learning how to iterate through the forest multiple times. Also learning
to store the forest in different data types.

===== What else would I have liked to do for this assignment?  =======
Figuring out the correct way to cycle through the forest multiple times.
